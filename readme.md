# Cryptosystems
1. Turing's Code (version 1.0)
    Turing's Code is a secret-key cryptosystem. This Code was made by 
    Alan Turing. 

    Text message is translated into an integer in order to perform mathematical Calculation. Translated integer must be prime . If it 
    is not a prime number we may need to pad the integer with more digits to make a prime.

    It requires, in Turing's code , secret key to be shared between two people beforehand.

    secret key must be prime.

    let m be message, and k be secret key then,

    Encryption : m* = mk
    Decryption : m = m*/k
